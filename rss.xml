            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Four reasons you'll always agree to this kind of request</h1><p>This is the only time that 'no' means 'yes'. I'll tell you why but first, did you know, asking someone for a favour can make them like you more? Well, in a kind of variation of that, if they turn you down for that first request, they're more likely to agree to help out with your next favour.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/dcb55706053644850ffdfe073292804e/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fthedirtpsychology.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2015%2F09%2Fnight-young-woods-photoshop-large.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Alert: IQ scores are meaningless - The Dirt Psychology -</h1><p>That doesn't come from me. That comes from Dr. Roger Highfield, the director of external affairs at the Science Museum in London and the first man to bounce a neutron off a soap bubble. He was commenting on one of the largest online surveys ever conducted on this subject and part of a study he co-authored, now published in the journal Neuron.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/3a19f25813fd58c4545e69abe56fdb04/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fthedirtpsychology.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F02%2Fpexels-photo.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The four ways we learn (and how they limit us)</h1><p>Have you ever suffered from the 'broken escalator phenomenon'? You step on a stopped escalator and feel like you're about to fall over for just a split second. Doesn't matter whether you knew it was moving or not right? Well, this oddity is a surprisingly apt introduction into how we view the world.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b5947cc8ee5e87adb6f23ce8ff016943/croprotate.jpg?cropheight=852&cropwidth=1280&degrees=0&input=http%3A%2F%2Fthedirtpsychology.org%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F04%2Fpeople-woman-coffee-meeting.jpg&x=0&y=0"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My Perfect 24 Hours, If I Were a Teleporting Billionaire | Travel Away</h1><p>Bear with me on this one. Let's say it's summer, end of August to be more precise. I live in Romania, I am a billionaire, and, of course, teleportation is possible.
